what is kubernates
   - kubernates is an open source container orechestration platform that automates the deployment
   - scaling and management of containerized applications
Benfits of kubernates?
   - Simplified application managemnt
   - Improved caling and avaliability
   - Easy deplyment and rollback
   - Improved resouce utilization
   - Increased portability and flexbility
Define container in kubernates?
   - container is lightweight standlone executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application including code runtime system tools librarues and settings
concept of kubernates cluster?
   - kubernates cluster is a set of nodes that run conatinerd applications, managed by the kubernates control plane
node in kuebrnates?
   - A node is a worker machine in kubernates that runs container applications
what are the key components of kubernates?
   - Master nodes, worker nodes, pods, services, deployments, replicaaets, statefulsets
what is POD in kubernates?
   - POD is smallest deployable unit in kubenates
   - It repersents a group of one or more containers that are scheduled together and share the same network namespaces,storage and IP adress
What is deployment in kubernates?
   - Deplyment manages a set of replicated pods and provides declartive updates to ensure the desired state of the applications
   - It supports rolling updates and rollbacks
How kubernates handle conatiner nerworking?
   - Kubernates assign a unique IP address to each POD and allows communications between pods using POD IP address 
   - It setup a virtual network thrugh plugins like CNI to enable network connectivity
What is service in kubernates?
   - service in kubernates is an abstraction that defines a stable network endpoint to access one or more pods
   - It provides load balancing and service discovery for PODS
What is Replicasets?
   - Replicset is responsible for ensuring a specided number of POD replicas are running at all time
   - It automatically scales the number of replicas based for PODS
   - kubectl scale deplyment myapp --replicas=5
   - use HPA 
   - kubectl autoscale deplyment myapp --cpu-percent=80 --min=2 --max=10
Stateful sets in kubernates?
   - used for managing stateful applications
   - provides guarantees about the oreding and uniqyunees of pods
Daemonset?
   - Ensures that a specifed pod runs on each node in the cluster
   - it is commnly used for cluster level opeartions such as log collection or montoring agents
Kubernates volumes
   - EmptyDIR, Hostoat, PV, PVC
PVC in kubernates?
   - PVC is a request for a specfic amount of storage resouces from a PV 
   - It allows pods to use persistent storage in a decpupled manner
Expose a servce ouside the kuernates cluster
   - nodeport
   - loadbalancer
   - ingress
Ingress in kunernates?
   -An Ingress is an API object used to manage external access to services within a cluster
   - It provides a way to configure rules for routing HTTP and HTTPS traffic to differnt services
How do you perform rolling updates in Kubernetes?
   - Rolling updates can be performed by updating the container image or configuration of a Deployment
   - Kubernetes will gradually replace the old Pods with the new ones, minimizing downtime.
What is the purpose of a readiness probe?
   - A readiness probe is used to determine if a Pod is ready to receive tra c.
   - Kubernetes uses this probe to determine when a Pod is fully operational and should be included in load balancing.
What is the purpose of the Kubernetes API server
   - The API server is the front-end interface for the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API
How do you secure access to the Kubernetes API server
   - Access to the Kubernetes API server can be secured using authentication mechanisms like certificates, tokens, or external authentication providers. 
   - RoleBased Access Control (RBAC) can also be implemented to manage user access.
How does Kubernetes handle rolling back a failed deployment?
   - Kubernetes allows you to roll back to a previous version of a Deployment by specifying the desired revision or using the kubectl rollout undo command. 
   - It reverts the Deployment to the previous state.
What is the purpose of a pod disruption budget (PDB)?
   - A Pod Disruption Budget defines the minimum number of Pods that must be available during a disruption caused by node maintenance or other events. 
   - It helps maintain application availability

what the use of configmaps 
  - configMaps store configuration data seperatly from application code
  - kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=env=prod

  - envFrom:
      - configMapRef:
          name : app-config

how do you persist data in kubenated pods?
  - use persistant volumes and persistent volume claims(PVC)

  - vol
